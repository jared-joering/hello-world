About Me

My name is Jared.  I'm a recent graduate of NKU (with honors), majoring in Information Technology with a Focus in Business Information Systems.  I'm presently trying to better myself through various means, whether it's honing my coding acumen here, or looking for various certificates to aid in my job search for a future in Data Analytics.
